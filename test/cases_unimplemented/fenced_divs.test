Fenced divs may be nested.

```
{#bar .foo}
::::
Hi

::: baz
> A block quote.
:::
::::
.
<div class="foo" id="bar">
<p>Hi</p>
<div class="baz">
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
```

A fenced div cannot interrupt a paragraph, without
an intervening blank line.

```
Paragraph text
::::
Hi
::::
.
<p>Paragraph text
::::
Hi
::::</p>
```

A fenced div need not have attributes or a class name.

```
::::
Hi
::::
.
<div>
<p>Hi</p>
</div>
```

The closing fence must be at least as long as the opening fence.

```
::::::::: foo
Hi
::::
.
<div class="foo">
<p>Hi
::::</p>
</div>
```

If the end of the input (or enclosing block) is encountered
before a closing fence, the fenced div is implicitly closed.

```
> :::: foo
> Hi
.
<blockquote>
<div class="foo">
<p>Hi</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
```

````
::: outer
```
:::
```
:::
.
<div class="outer">
<pre><code>:::
</code></pre>
</div>
````
